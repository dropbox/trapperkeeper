# Trap handlers are how we react to receiving specified traps. All
# handlers inherit from the default settings which are configured
# under the defaults header as well as the possibility of inheriting
# from a template.
#
# Defaults:
defaults:
    # Expiration is how long a trap stays in an active state. a null
    # value will indicate the trap needs to be manually resolved.
    #
    # Type: str (time spec)
    expiration: "15m"

    # Blackhole allows you to drop traps on the floor, never
    # making it to e-mail or the database. This is useful for
    # very chatty traps that you don't care about.
    #
    # Type: bool
    blackhole: false

    # Sets the default severity of all traps. Severity is useful
    # in use with external monitoring. For example you might want to
    # Page on critical, E-mail on warning, and ignore informational.
    #
    # Type str (Allowed informational, warning, critical)
    severity: "warning"

    # If you don't want mail sent by default you would comment
    #  out this section. If mail is null no e-mail will be sent.
    mail:
        # The subject to use for mail that is sent. The following
        # format strings are available to use:
        #   hostname:  The hostname of the agent that sent the trap.
        #   ipaddress: The IP address of the agent that sent the trap.
        #   trap_name: The textual name for the received trap.
        #   trap_oid:  The OID for the received trap.
        #
        # Type: str
        subject: "%(hostname)s %(trap_name)s"

        # The recipients of the message, comma delimited, for a given
        # trap. If this value is falsey then no e-mail is sent.
        #
        # Type: str
        recipients: "root@localhost"

    # When running multiple instances of trapperkeeper as a manager for a
    # given device, the message will be deduplicated in the database. If
    # you want the e-mail to be sent even when the message has been
    # deduplicated then mark this true
    #
    # Type: bool
    mail_on_duplicate: false

# Templates allow you to set up a class of traps to reduce the amount of
# configuration required per handler. All options available above (in the
# defaults section) are available under templates.
#
# Templates:
templates:
    # This is the name for the template. You can use any name you like
    # though I'm overloading the severity names as they map pretty cleanly
    # to the class of traps I normally receive.
    critical:
        expiration: null
        severity: "critical"

    informational:
        expiration: "0s"
        severity: "informational"
        mail: null

# Finally you have the actual configuration for various traps. In this
# section you actually have configuration for individual traps. Again
# all of the options above (defaults) are available with use additional
# keyword, use, to inherit from templates.
#
# Trap Handlers:
traphandlers:
    # Name or OID of the trap to match on.
